For The Tetris Lab project first worked on the Block classes.  Developed and implemented a generic, bounded grid class that can store different types of objects, and to use this grid to manage colored block objects through their placement, removal, and manipulation on the grid.

Designed and programmed a functional Tetris game using previously build grid and block classes. Implemented classes for game board, falling shapes, input controls and advanced game mechanics such as row completion and score tracking.
